In This project, you will be required to analyze the recruitment data and communicate insights on what a HR company can do to optimize the hiring process. 
You have been provided by the data - Recruitment Data. 

You need to calculate the following metrics:

- Open Days
- End of probation date
- Time Between Onboarding to file Openning

You will then use the resultant fields to create a dashboard that highlights the performance of the recruitment process as below:
